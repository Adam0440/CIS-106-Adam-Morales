CIS 106 Projects
I am taking this course to further develop my knowledge on coding and hopefully work my way up the course levels so I can have the skills capable of being a software engineer. This is my first ever class that has coding in it, and hopefully I enjoy it because I plan to build a career in technology since I see it is a growing industry with the potential to make a lot of money if you play your cards right. I'm honestly extremely grateful to grow up in a era where technology is so rooted into everything we do because I believe it has opened more pathways and opportunities to build a career with in it. Besides skills I also plan to build a better understanding of how a career in technology actually looks like, because to be quite honest before registring I really didn't have any idea.
